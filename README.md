# Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) Principles
In Event-Driven Architecture, systems communicate by publishing events that other components can react to. 
This approach emphasizes real-time responses and loose coupling between services. 
The core principle is that each component only reacts to events it cares about, 
rather than polling for data or having explicit dependencies on other systems.

# Event Storming
Event Storming is a collaborative workshop technique used to identify the key events in a 
business domain. It helps teams understand the flow of events and how they relate to one another. 
Participants create a diagram with the main events, processes, and decisions as sticky notes or cards. 
This visual representation reveals patterns, bottlenecks, and areas for improvement. 
By identifying the essential events, teams can design more efficient EDA systems that respond 
accurately to business needs.

# Bounded Contexts
A Bounded Context is an important concept in Domain-Driven Design (DDD) that complements EDA principles. 
It refers to a well-defined part of the overall domain where a specific set of events and rules apply. 
Each bounded context has its own domain model, language, and processes. 
By defining clear boundaries between contexts, teams can avoid unnecessary complexity and focus on the 
specific aspects relevant to each event stream. This leads to more maintainable, scalable, 
and understandable systems that accurately capture business logic within each context.
